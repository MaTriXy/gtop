Server monitoring and administration, right from Google Glass.

### About

Glass seems like a very awesome way of presenting information to your face. I thought it might make a great server monitor/administration system. It's one of the many Glass apps I'm working on, and one of my favorite.

This is currently very beta and experimental, but I'm making progress. This is designed to be installed locally on the box you intend to monitor, creating a secure link between Google, your server, and Glass. That's about as direct as it gets with the Mirror API.

If you want to see how it looks/works, I have a test version installed on my server! Feedback and ideas are appreciated, just make an issue!
